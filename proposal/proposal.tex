\title{HIVE-13680: Provide a way to compress ResultSets}
\author{Kevin Liew}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	Hive data pipelines invariably involve JDBC/ODBC drivers which access Hive through its Thrift interface. 
	Consequently, any enhancement to the Thrift vector will benefit all users.
	
	Prior to 
	\href{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12049}{HIVE-12049}
	, HiveServer2 would read a full ResultSet from HDFS before deserializing and re-serializing into Thrift objects for RPC transfer.
	Following our enhancement, task nodes serialize Thrift objects from their own block of a ResultSet file. 
	HiveServer2 reads the Thrift output and transfers it to the remote client. 
	This parallel serialization strategy reduced latency in the data pipeline.
	
	However, network capacity is often the most scarce resource in a system. 
	As a further enhancement, network load can be eased by having task nodes compress their own block of a ResultSet as part of the serialization process.

\section{Introduction}
	The changes proposed herein draw from Rohit Dholakia's design document and patches for
	\href{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-10438}{HIVE-10438}, which implemented compression on HiveServer2.
	Now that
	\href{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12049}{HIVE-12049}
	has been committed, compression can take place in parallel on the task nodes.
	
	Our goals for this enhancement are to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item improve performance out-of-the-box for new clients
		\item maintain compatibility with old clients
		\item provide flexibility yet security
		\item confer a simple interface
	\end{itemize}
	
\section{Design Overview}

	\subsection{Compressor Interface}
		We will define a compressor interface which must be implemented by compressor plugins.
		A Snappy compressor will compress all data-types using the Snappy algorithm.
		Type-specific compression can be achieved by implementing a compressor that delegates compression to other compressors based on a case-switch block.
		
	\subsection{Client-Server Negotiation}
		Upon connection, both the client and server will send a list of compressors ordered by preference.
		Both the client and server will choose the first compressor in the server's list that also exists in the client's list.
		All results for that session will be compressed using that compressor.
		The results will not be compressed if there are no compressors available on both the server and client.
		This negotiation scheme will maintain compatibility with old clients while using compression whenever it is available.

\section{Implementation}
	
	\subsection{Compression}
		The output of a final node in a DAG is either a set of rows (from a map task) or a single value (from a reduce task).
		Following
		\href{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12049}{HIVE-12049}
		, the output is buffered row-by-row into TColumns in TRowSet and serialized in batches to a file in HDFS.
		The final output file is read by HiveServer2 (deserializing the columns as a binary blob) and sent to the client.
		
		Compressors will operate on the batch-level in ThriftJDBCBinarySerDe and compressed batches will be serialized contiguously in the output file. 
		
		In the event that a column is not compressible, the column will be serialized as an uncompressed column.
		
	\subsection{Decompression}
		Results are serialized in contiguous compressed batches. Consequently, the client must deserialize batch-by-batch.
		
		TBD
		%where does decompression occur in the client? will we operate on (Encoded)ColumnBasedSet or directly on TRowSet?
		
	\subsection{Compressed RowSet Structures}
		\subsubsection{HiveServer2 Structures}
			TBD
		
		\subsubsection{Thrift Objects}
			TEnColumn must now store a list of batch offsets to delimit the compressed blob and allow decompression of contiguous batches of rows within each column. TRowSet will have a list of TEnColumn to store compressed columns.
			Otherwise, the Thrift structures used to support compression are largely unchanged from 
			\href{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-10438}{HIVE-10438}
			. They are described here for completeness.
			
			\begin{lstlisting}[title=TCLIService.thrift,gobble=8,otherkeywords={binary,i32,i64,string,struct,TColumn,TEnColumn,TRow,TRowSet,TTypeId}]
				//Represents an encoded column
				struct TEnColumn {
					1: required binary enData
					2: required binary nulls
					3: required TTypeId type
				}
				
				// Represents a rowset
				struct TRowSet {
					// The starting row offset of this rowset.
					1: required i64 startRowOffset
					2: required list<TRow> rows
					3: optional list<TColumn> columns
					4: optional binary binaryColumns
					5: optional i32 columnCount
					6: optional list<TEnColumn> enColumns
					7: optional string compressorName
				}
			\end{lstlisting}
			
			TEnColumns `enData` is a binary blob containing the contiguous compressed batches within the node's block of the output file.
			`nulls` is a bitmap indicating null rows in the column set.
			`type` is the column's data-type.
			
			TRowSet `startRowOffet` and `rows` are deprecated following \href{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-3746}{HIVE-3746}.
			Result files are now column-oriented and either in `binaryColumns` (in the task nodes and on HiveServer2) or a combination of `columns` and `enColumns` (in the client).
			`compressorName` indicates the compressor plugin that was used to compress the result set.
			
	\subsection{Compressor-Decompressor Interface}
		\begin{lstlisting}[title=org.apache.hive.service.cli.CompDe; CompDe.java,gobble=6,otherkeywords={ColumnBuffer}]
			@InterfaceAudience.Private
			@InterfaceStability.Stable
			public interface ColumnCompDe {
				public byte[] compress(ColumnBuffer columns);
				public ColumnBuffer decompress(byte[] columnsBlob);
				public boolean isCompressible(ColumnBuffer columns);
			}
		\end{lstlisting}
		
		Operating in the final task node, `compress` takes a batch of rows contained in `columns` (number of rows will be equal to or less than \linebreak hive.server2.thrift.resultset.max.fetch.size) and outputs a binary blob.
		The compressor is free to pack additional details such as look-up tables within this blob.
		`isCompressible` is checked by the server before compressing a column.
		
		The client receives results batch-by-batch. calling `decompress` on each batch to receive a ColumnBuffer containing the rows of that batch.
			
\section{Custom Compressors}
		A default compressor will be provided for Snappy compression.
		To use other compression algorithms or to have type-specific compression, the user must implement the CompDe interface.
		
		TBD
